## Objective of this package

This package allows users to combine two dataframes with similar column
headers and classes. Also, there is an option to remove duplicates using
value column. valuecol parameter is passed on to the function. The
function removes duplicate rows by looking at all the column header
except the ones mentioned in the valuecol parameter. There are many use
cases for this package, especially related to saving time specific
information. For example, lets say the user has weather information for
the last 365 days and also 7 days in the future. Weather information for
the days in the past does not change but the weather forecast for the
next 7 days keep changing as we move further into the future. This
package plays an important role when we have to combined the existing
weather information, with all the latest information that is going to
come in the future. Sufficient examples are illustrated below to save
the user from any confusion.
